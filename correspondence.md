# Correspondence

Correspondence is a property by which events in [parallel universes] appear to be equivalent. In [factually connected](connectivity.md#factual-connectivity) universes, correspondent events are typically people, places, and historical events that are the same or similar. In [fictionally connected](connectivity.md#fictional-connectivity) universes (especially those which are not [alternate](alternate-universe.md) with respect to one another), correspondence may take a more abstract form, but the same general principle applies.

The amount of equivalence required for two events to be correspondent is not well-defined, as correspondence is not a fundamental property of parallel universes. Rather, correspondence is a label given to similar events that occur in multiple universes.

## Strong Correspondence

Strong correspondence, less commonly called _alternacy_, is a strict form of correspondence that satisfies [category](#conservation-of-category) and [multiplicity](#conservation-of-multiplicity) conservation. All observed correspondence among factually connected universes is strong correspondence.

### Conservation of Category

The conservation of category states that correspondent events shall be of the same overall type. For example, a place is correspondent with another place, a person with another person, a nation with another nation, etc.

### Conservation of Multiplicity

Conservation of multiplicity states that the number of correspondent events is the same among universes. For example, conservation of multiplicity states that a person may only be correspondent with one other person.

## Weak Correspondence

Weak correspondence is correspondence that violates at least one of conservation of category or conservation of multiplicity. Fictionally connected universes are the only universes that can exhibit weak correspondence.

Multiplicity violation can result in a single event in one universe corresponding to multiple events in another universe. It is fairly common for one person in this universe to correspond to multiple people in the fictionally connected Vedtren System.

Category violation can result in an event corresponding with an externally different event. For example, a person in one universe may correspond to a place in a fictionally connected universe.
