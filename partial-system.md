# Partial System
_"Hive mind" redirects here._

A partial system is a type of [conscious system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) composed of a single [ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Ego) and multiple [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism). Natural partial systems are rare, although there are some documented occurrences of partial systems in human populations. Partial systems are also known colloquially as _hive minds_, _shared consciousnesses_, or sometimes _collectives_ (although _collective_ may also refer to [other system types](https://morethanone.info)).

## Types of Partial Systems

Partial systems may be categorized into four groups whose attributes span two axes. _Centralizaton_, which refers to the unity or atomicity of the single underlying consciousness, and _differentiation_, which is the degree to which the member organisms are physically different. The four overreaching categories of partial systems are as follows.

- _Swarms_ are undifferentiated and decentralized.
- _Gestalts_ are undifferentiated and centralized.
- _Collectives_ are differentiated and decentralized.
- _Machines_ are differentiated and centralized.
