# Partial System
_"Hive mind" redirects here._

The partial system is an organ system present in "hive minds", a type of [collective consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) composed of a single [ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Ego) and multiple [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism). Those that exhibit activity associated with the partial system are also called _shared consciousnesses_, or sometimes _collectives_ (although _collective_ may also refer to [other system types](https://morethanone.info)). The partial system mediates communication among members of such a consciousness.

Individuals within hive minds may have their own names and identities, although names will often share a component among all members, which forms the collective name of the hive.

## Expression of the Partial System

Partial system expression may be categorized into four groups whose attributes span two axes. _Centralizaton_, which refers to the unity or atomicity of the single underlying consciousness, and _differentiation_, which is the degree to which the member organisms are physically different. The four overreaching categories of partial system are as follows.

- _Swarms_ are undifferentiated and decentralized.
- _Gestalts_ are undifferentiated and centralized.
- _Collectives_ are differentiated and decentralized.
- _Machines_ are differentiated and centralized.

## History

The term _partial system_ comes from one of the first external published descriptions of shared consciousness phenomena.

> The individuals of such a group share a single system of consciousness; possessing the ability to transfer thoughts, emotions, and decisions among members with apparent ease. Many individuals describe themselves as but a single part of a larger whole, although some are able to act of their own volition as well.

## System Integrity Deterioration

The most notable disease affecting the partial system is System Integrity Deterioration Disorder (SIDD), in which members of hives lose the ability to communicate among their constituent members. It is proposed that some planetary systems have low rates of shared consciousness because they have high rates of SIDD. 

## Notable Entities in Partial System Research

- [Collective Valora], a major proponent of [SIDD] awareness and research.
- The [Syringean Hive], currently the largest known collective consciousness by number of members.
