# Alternate Universe
_Not to be confused with [Parallel Universe]._

An alternate universe, also known as a _mirror universe_, is a subset of [parallel universe] in which the laws of physics, and to a lesser extent natural and historical events, mirror the real world. Events and people that seem to be present in both universes are called _correspondents_.

## Vedtren System

The Vedtren System is located in an alternate universe which is [fictionally connected] to this universe. Because of this fictional connection, corresponding events in the Vedtren System are less reflective than what would be expected of a [really connected] alternate universe. Because connection is symmetric, this universe is also an alternate universe of the Vedtren System.
