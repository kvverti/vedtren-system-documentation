# Connectivity

Connectivity is a concept by which [parallel universes], including [alternate universes](alternate-universe.md), are related to the real world. A universe is _factually connected_  with another universe if it is possible to transfer information between the two, and is otherwise _fictionally connected_.

## Factual Connectivity

Factual connectivity between universes allows the transfer of information, matter, and energy between the two universes. This effectively allows the two universes, as well as any other universes really connected to them, to be causally linked. This implies that factual connectivity must obey the laws of physics present in all connected universes, and thus that all factually connected universes are [alternate](alternate-universe.md) with respect to one another.

There are no discovered universes which are factually connected to this universe. Since factual connectivity has been observed in fictionally connected universes, it is not unlikely that there is at least one universe that is factually connected with this universe.

## Fictional Connectivity

In contrast to factual connectivity, fictional conectivity between universes does not allow the transfer of information. However, while fictionally connected universes cannot influence each other causally, they can influence each other [synchronously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity). The Vedtren System itself is fictionally connected to this universe, as well as many of the universes present in written fiction, theatre, and film. Because there is no causal connection among fictionaly connected universes, the laws of physics governing such universes may be substantially different among them.

## Connectivity Exclusion Principle

No universe has yet been observed to be both factually and fictionally connected to another universe. It has been proposed that this type of multiconnectivity cannot occur. That is, a universe cannot influence another universe both causally and synchronously.

As the Vedtren System already exhibits fictional connectivity with this universe, it remains unlikely that it will ever causally influence or be influenced by any otherwise correspondent system in this universe.
