# The Gateway

The Gateway is a transportation hub connecting the alternate universes in the Greater Vedtren Systems. It has terminals of varying sizes in several alternate universes, and contains a network of endogenous pathways that contain the actual connections. The Gateway's terminals are mostly located in orbit above the correpsondent planets, but some connections on the surface in major city centers exist. The Gateway and its various substations constitute a major facilitator of intersystem commerce and exchange among the Systems.

## Ownership

The Gateway is collectively owned and maintained by the [Council of Alternate Systems]. Each constituent system maintains the portion of the Gateway contained inside their own universe, and the Council collectively maintains the connections between universes.
