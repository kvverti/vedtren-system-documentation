# Seske

Seske (/ð͇eʃkə/) is the most common name for the scorpion goddess of time, space, and the mind. The name _Seske_ is from the language most common among the
alternate systems, but other languages spoken within the systems use strikingly similar names, such as _Serke_ ([Fifth Quadrant]), _Sarka_ ([Vedtren Republic]),
and _Sheket_ ([Insular Ventar]). In all instances, Seske takes the form of a large scorpion.

It is said that Seske has the ability to traverse all universes, both causally and synchonously.
