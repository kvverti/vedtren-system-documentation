# Endogeny

Endogeny is the study of _endoverses_ and methods of creating and sustaining them. 

## Endoverse

An endoverse, also known as an _endogenous universe_ or _pocket universe_, is a universe created directly from another universe. Endoverses are typically small in space, although naturally ocurring endoverses can reach sizes several thousands of light years in extent. Endoverses, unlike [gateways], house an internal space in their own right and are generally connected to only a single other universe.
