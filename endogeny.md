# Endogeny

Endogeny is the study of _endoverses_ and methods of creating and sustaining them. 

## Endoverse

An endoverse, also known as an _endogenous universe_ or _pocket universe_, is a universe created directly from or formed inside of another universe. Endoverses are typically small in space and time, although naturally ocurring endoverses can reach sizes several thousands of light years in extent. Endoverses are generally connected to only a single other universe, although some endoverses may be connected to multiple alternate universes.

Naturally ocurring endoverses typically exhibit high positive spacial curvature due to their finite extent. Less commonly, naturally ocurring endoverses may exhibit a [flat torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus#Flat_torus) structure. The structure of endoverses has always been observed to be [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability), meaning that it is not possible to turn an object into its mirror image or to [reverse the polarity of charged particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-orientable_wormhole#Alice_universe).
